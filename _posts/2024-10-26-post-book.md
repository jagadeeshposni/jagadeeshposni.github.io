To Kill a Mockingbird.

There was a period when I found myself spending countless hours reading Quora articles, and this book was consistently recommended. Influenced by these suggestions, I decided to purchase the paperback from Amazon. It’s well-known that the book is quite controversial and has even been banned in some schools across the US. I had no idea it would become one of the most transformative books I’ve ever read.

There are some lines from it that I still find myself reflecting on...

> “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.” 

> “People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for.” 

> “Atticus told me to delete the adjectives and I'd have the facts.” 

> “Pass the damn ham, please.” 
:D 

> “Atticus had said it was the polite thing to talk to people about what they were interested in, not about what you were interested in.”
