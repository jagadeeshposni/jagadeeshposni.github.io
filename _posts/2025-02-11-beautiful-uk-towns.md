A collection of some of the beautiful towns I have visited in England.

Starting with the banner image - Exmoor National Park.

An impromptu trip with one of my mates, stunning views, breathtaking drive and the fog attributed more drama. We stopped the car in one of many road side parking spots on the way to Lynmouth only discover this view point.

A town straight out of a fantasy - Burton On The Water

Roughly about one and half hour drive from the midlands, Cotswolds landscape is something not be missed in England. The yellowish tint on these modelled villages in cotswolds is spot on.

A place that reminded me of tower of joy from Game of Thrones - Broadway Tower
