Hi. I'm jagadeesh, a software engineer by both passion and profession. I live in the United Kingdom and work for the Department for Work and Pensions. In the past I have worked for companies like [gap](gap.com), IBM, OSI digital where I have helped my teams build exciting things on retail customer experience modules like shopping cart, checkout and order processing. I am fortunate enough to not just stick to building components remotely but visit the sites where the products I have built were being used by real users. I have witnessed, tested and signed off go-live activities where users of the software systems recieve and sort items into the warehouse,  pick and pack items for customer orders and debug multiple issues sitting on a warehouse floor. Some naughty things include updating production databases, driving golf cart inside warehouse.

I am a optimist, contrarian and belives in "regret minimization". It is for those reasons, I have started this blog mainly to document my flowing thoughts and come back to ideas that I want to explore more. Off late, i have discovered that writing helps me structure thoughts and also realized that writing consistently and effectively is one of the hardest things to do. Not every essay/post might be relevant/interesting but if you enjoy some and willing to chat, you can reach me [via email](mailto: jagadeeshposni@gmail.com)
