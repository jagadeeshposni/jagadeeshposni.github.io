To kill a mocking bird.

it was  a time where I was spending hours and hours of reading quora articles and everywhere I go, this book has been most recommended. I got influenced and bought the paperback off amazon. It is also known that the book is quite controversial and ha sbeen banned in some schoold in the US. Little did I know that it was going ot be one of the life changing book I was going to pick up.

Some lines that I still keep thinking about..


> “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.” 

> “People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for.” 

> “Atticus told me to delete the adjectives and I'd have the facts.” 

> “Pass the damn ham, please.” 
:D 

> “Atticus had said it was the polite thing to talk to people about what they were interested in, not about what you were interested in.”
