For as far as I can remember, since I was may be 15 years old, not even a single day went without me starting my day with 1 litre of water and going to the loo.

Doesn't matter where I'm - hometown, city I live now or in the past, Friends place, vacation, hospital, on top of a cliff. Doesn't matter what time I wake up. Every single day, I drank one litre of water first thing and go to loo immediately. 

Being consistent helps but writing about my poo habits? I will have to improve this post.
