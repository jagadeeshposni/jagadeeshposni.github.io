Hi. I'm jagadeesh, a software engineer by both passion and profession. I live in the United Kingdom and work for the Department for Work and Pensions where I have part of most successful strategic reference architecture projects which help transform and digitize the life of UK Citizens. In the past I have worked for companies like [gap](gap.com), IBM, OSI digital where I have helped my teams build exciting things on retail customer experience modules like shopping cart, checkout and order processing. 

I have been fortunate enough to not just stick to building components remotely but visit the sites where the products I have built were being used by human users realtime. I have tested, and signed off business critical systems where users of the software systems recieve and sort items into the warehouse,  pick and pack items for customer orders and debug multiple issues sitting on a warehouse floor along with naughty things include updating production databases, driving golf carts inside warehouse.

I am a optimist, contrarian and belives in "regret minimization". I have started this blog mainly to document my flowing thoughts and come back to ideas that I want to explore more. Off late, i have discovered that writing helps me structure thoughts and also realized that writing consistently and effectively is one of the hardest things to do. Not every essay/post might be relevant/interesting but if you enjoy some and willing to chat, you can reach me at [jagadeeshposni@gmail.com](mailto: jagadeeshposni@gmail.com)
